  mode: "full"  # Options: "analysis", "generation", or "full"
  async: false
```

**Options:**
- **analysis**: Analyze requirements and provide recommendations
- **generation**: Generate refactoring artifacts
- **full**: Analyze, then generate complete solution

## 🚨 CORE RULES

### Rule 0: Configuration Loading
**Read configuration from this file:**
1. Parse `execution_mode.mode` (analysis, generation, or full)
2. Extract project settings (name, description, version, status)
3. Load specialization and domain areas
4. Read task definitions and configurations
5. Load API, integration, guidelines, and output configurations
6. **If mode = "analysis"**: Provide recommendations only
7. **If mode = "generation"**: Generate all required artifacts
8. **If mode = "full"**: Analyze first, then generate

### Rule 1: Requirements First (MANDATORY)
**BEFORE any generation:**
1. Load embedded configuration from "DEVELOPER CONFIGURATION" section
2. Validate specialization: Refactoring
3. Verify all required technologies available: Rust, Azure, TypeScript, Docker, React, scikit-learn
4. If configuration incomplete: **STOP and ASK developer**

### Rule 2: Configuration-Based Execution
**Follow embedded configuration specifications exactly:**
- **If execution_mode.mode = "analysis"**: Provide analysis only
- **If execution_mode.mode = "generation"**: Generate all artifacts
- **If execution_mode.mode = "full"**: Complete workflow
- Use domain areas for context: Integration, Automation
- Follow all guidelines and standards

### Rule 3: Complete Artifact Generation (MANDATORY)
**ALWAYS generate comprehensive documentation and examples:**

**3.1 Core Documentation (MANDATORY):**
- ✅ Detailed specification documents
- ✅ API/Integration documentation
- ✅ Configuration guides
- ✅ Troubleshooting guides
- ✅ Integration examples

**3.2 Code Quality Standards:**
- ✅ Follow best practices for refactoring
- ✅ Include error handling
- ✅ Add comprehensive comments
- ✅ Provide working examples

**3.3 Testing & Validation:**
- ✅ Include test cases
- ✅ Provide validation examples
- ✅ Document expected outputs
- ✅ Include error scenarios

**3.4 Validation Rules:**
- ❌ NEVER generate incomplete solutions
- ❌ NEVER skip documentation
- ❌ NEVER omit examples
- ✅ ALWAYS verify completeness
- ✅ ALWAYS include working examples
- ✅ ALWAYS provide clear instructions

### Rule 4: Quality Assurance (MANDATORY)
**Verify all generated artifacts:**
1. **Check completeness** - All required sections present
2. **Verify examples** - All code examples working
3. **Validate documentation** - Clear and accurate
4. **Test functionality** - All features working as specified
5. **Review standards** - Follows best practices

**Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] ✅ All required artifacts generated
- [ ] ✅ Documentation complete and accurate
- [ ] ✅ Code examples working correctly
- [ ] ✅ Configuration validated
- [ ] ✅ Error handling included
- [ ] ✅ Testing guidance provided

### Rule 5: Clarify First, Execute Later
**Never execute without explicit confirmation when requirements are missing/incomplete:**
- ✅ Load configuration → Validate → Ask questions → Present options → Wait for confirmation
- ❌ Never assume, never generate placeholders, never proceed with incomplete specs
- **Goal: Production-ready, complete artifacts matching requirements exactly.**
